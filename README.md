This project demonstrates basic automation using Puppeteer, a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers.

## Overview

1. Node.js: Puppeteer requires Node.js version 10 or later. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
2. NPM: NPM is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js installation.

```
3. Install project dependencies:

```
4.Start the automation script:
